This tutorial will walk you through building a simple, fully functional, Backbone.js todo application. It will
have the following dependencies: 

* backbone.js
* backbone.localStorage.js
* underscore.js
* jquery.js
* jquery.tmpl.js

Each of these javascript files is located in the lib directory.

## Instructions

There are 4 steps to this tutorial. Each step is in a separate branch

* step-1
* step-2
* step-3
* step-4

You should start at step one and work your way through. 

## Why another Backbone tutorial.

Most tutorials start with a fully functional app and explain what each piece does. It can get kind of confusing 
when you're looking at so much code.
